 * In this prediction game, the first player gives the second player some stock market data for some consecutive days.
 * The data contains a company's stock price on each day.
 * The rule for the game is quite simple:
 *    Player 1 will tell player 2 a day number and play 2 has to find the nearest day on which stock price is smaller than the given day.
 *    If there are two results, then player 2 has to find the day number which is smaller and if no such day exists, then the correct answer would be -1.
