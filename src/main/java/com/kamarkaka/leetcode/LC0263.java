/***
 * 263. Ugly Number
 * An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
 * Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *    Input: n = 6
 *    Output: true
 *    Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
 *
 * Example 2:
 *    Input: n = 1
 *    Output: true
 *    Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *    Input: n = 14
 *    Output: false
 *    Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * -2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
