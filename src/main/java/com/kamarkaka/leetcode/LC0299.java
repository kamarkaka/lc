/***
 * 299. Bulls and Cows
 * You are playing the Bulls and Cows game with your friend.
 * You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:
 *   The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
 *   The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.
 * Given the secret number secret and your friend's guess guess, return the hint for your friend's guess.
 * The hint should be formatted as "xAyB", where x is the number of bulls and y is the number of cows. Note that both secret and guess may contain duplicate digits.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
 *   Output: "1A3B"
 *   Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
 *     "1807"
 *       |
 *     "7810"
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"
 *   Output: "1A1B"
 *   Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
 *     "1123"        "1123"
 *       |      or     |
 *     "0111"        "0111"
 *     Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000
 *   secret.length == guess.length
 *   secret and guess consist of digits only.
