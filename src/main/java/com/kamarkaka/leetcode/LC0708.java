/***
 * 708. Insert into a Sorted Circular Linked List
 * Given a Circular Linked List node, which is sorted in ascending order, write a function to insert a value insertVal
 * into the list such that it remains a sorted circular list. The given node can be a reference to any single node in
 * the list and may not necessarily be the smallest value in the circular list.
 * If there are multiple suitable places for insertion, you may choose any place to insert the new value. After the
 * insertion, the circular list should remain sorted.
 * If the list is empty (i.e., the given node is null), you should create a new single circular list and return the
 * reference to that single node. Otherwise, you should return the originally given node.
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: head = [3,4,1], insertVal = 2
 *   Output: [3,4,1,2]
 *   Explanation: In the figure above, there is a sorted circular list of three elements. You are given a reference to
 *   the node with value 3, and we need to insert 2 into the list. The new node should be inserted between node 1 and
 *   node 3. After the insertion, the list should look like this, and we should still return node 3.
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: head = [], insertVal = 1
 *   Output: [1]
 *   Explanation: The list is empty (given head is null). We create a new single circular list and return the reference
 *   to that single node.
 * Example 3:
 *   Input: head = [1], insertVal = 0
 *   Output: [1,0]
 * Constraints:
 *   The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 10^4].
 *   -10^6 <= Node.val, insertVal <= 10^6
