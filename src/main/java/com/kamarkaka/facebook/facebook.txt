You are given a calendar year represented as a char array or string that contains either H or W, where: H = Holiday, W = Workday.
You are also given the number of days that you can take off from work: Personal Time-Off, PTO.
Find the length of the longest vacation you can take, that is, the maximum number of consecutive days you can be away from work.
For simplicity, the calendar does not wrap around.
Example:
[W, H, H, W, W, H, W], PTO=2, -> 5
